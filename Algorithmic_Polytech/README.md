# Algorithmic Polytech

## Content

This is a condensed beginner algorithmic class in French covering the following subjects:

 * Complexity
 * Data structures
 * Recursivity
 * Sorting algorithms
 * Trees

It contains: the lecture material, the exercises and IPython notebooks used throughout
the year. 

## Public

This has been written for the students of the School [Polytech Paris-Sud](http://www.polytech.u-psud.fr/fr/index.html).
My students are undergrads, in their 3rd year post High School of 5 years to graduate
as Engineers in Computer Science. 

They are *apprentis*, which means they spend half of their time working as developers
in a company and half of their time at school. 

They usually have already quite a good knowledge of programming but not much of 
a theoretical approach.

## Spirit

The spirit of the course is to give a short practical overview of algorithmic. 
Basically, this class contains what I believe *any software engineer* should know
about algorithmic.

Note that it is far from being exhaustive. The lecture notes are written so that
the students can rely on a printout for the most important informations. It gives me
the freedom to only loosely rely on it while I teach and to spend my time discussing
and explaining.

## Time frame

The class consists of 32 hours of lectures / exercise sessions and 16 hours in front
of Computers. Due to their *apprentis* status, my students have quite an 
irregular schedule and these hours are spread out from October to May by sessions
of 4 hours in a row (that is dense!).

## Authorship

I am the sole author if this class.
