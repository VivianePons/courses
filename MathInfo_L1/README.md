## Content

This is the content of a pluri-disciplinary class involving mathematics and
computer science.

The *SMCWorksheets* folder contains worksheets to be run on the platform [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/)
using [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/). Their intent is to teach the basics
of Sage and Python through exercises and examples.

The *Projects* folder contains a list of pluri-disciplinary projects. They are all 
divided into two parts: the first part consists of mathematical
questions and the second part is a computer exploration / modelization approach. 

The projects are conceived to be realized through [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)
but any programming language could do.


## Public

This has been written for the students of [Paris-Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr/fr/formations/diplomes/licences/sciences-technologies-sante/mpi.html)
in their first undergrad year, following the common program for mathematics,
computer science and physics.

This is an optional class for the second semester of the program. Students have 
followed a programming class for one semester but most of them still have very 
little knowledge in programming.

## Spirit

The spirit of this class is to lead the students to conduct challenging projects
on their own, following their own ideas and questions. 

## Time frame

This is a one semester class divided into 11 2-hours sessions plus one final 4-hours 
session where students present their work. There is no formal
lectures: every session is conducted in a computer room. 

During the first 5 to 6 sessions, students work on the SMC worksheets so that 
they can familiarize themselves with Sage and python. The rest of the semester
is dedicated to the realization of the projects. The time frame allows for most 
of the coding to be done in class, so that the students can benefit from the help 
of the teacher.
