# Mathinfo L1

## Content

This is the content of a pluri-disciplinary class involving mathematics and
computer science.

The *SMCWorksheets* folder contains worksheets to be run on the
[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) online platform, using
[SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), the Sage mathematics software system,
also called Sage for short. The intent is to teach the basics
of Sage and Python through exercises and examples.

The *Projects* folder contains a list of pluri-disciplinary projects. Each
of them is divided into two parts: the first part consists of mathematical
questions, the second part is a computer exploration / modelization approach.

The projects are designed with [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) in mind,
but any programming language can be used instead.

## Public

This course was written for first year undergraduate students following the
[common program for mathematics, computer science and physics at Universit√© Paris-Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr/fr/formations/diplomes/licences/sciences-technologies-sante/mpi.html).

This course is an optional one, in the second semester of that program. Students
have followed a programming class in the previous semester but most of them still
have very little knowledge in programming.

## Spirit

The spirit of this class is to lead students to undertake challenging projects
on their own, following their own ideas and questions.

## Time frame

This is a one-semester class divided into 11 two-hour sessions plus one final
four-hour session where students present their work. There is no formal lectures:
every session is run in a computer room.

During the first 5 to 6 sessions, students work on prepared worksheets so that
they can familiarize themselves with Sage and Python. The rest of the semester
is dedicated to the realization of the projects. The time frame allows for most
of the coding to be done in class, so that students can benefit from the help
of those teaching the course.
